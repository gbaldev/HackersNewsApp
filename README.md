# Getting Started

>**Note**: I will assume that you will be testing this in an iOS simulator or an android emulator, previously set up by your own.

## Step 1: Install

First, run:
```bash
# NPM
npm install
cd ios
pod install
```

## Step 2: Start Metro

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# NPM
npm start
```

## Step 3: Run application

In Metro terminal:

### For iOS

Press i

### For Android

press a

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see the app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
